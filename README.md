# Prepare tidy data for later analysis
This repo is the course project of Getting and Cleaning Data, whose goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. <br>
The row data is about wearable computing, and a full description is available at the site:<br> http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones. <br>
The link of the data:<br>

This repo contains a script called run_analysis.r, which can do the following:<br>
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. <br>
3. Name the activities in the data set using descriptive activity names.<br>
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. <br>
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>
